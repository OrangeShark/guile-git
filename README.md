# Guile-Git

Guile-Git is a GNU Guile library providing bindings to
[libgit2](https://libgit2.org/).

## Documentation

The documentation is currently a work in progress, so please read the
source and have a look at the [libgit2 API](https://libgit2.org/libgit2/#HEAD).

## How to contribute

The easiest way to start hacking on guile-git is to install
[GNU Guix](https://gnu.org/s/guix) and run the following command:

```bash
> guix environment -l guix.scm
```

You can then:

- Create a pull request on gitlab
- Send a patch to one of the maintainers
- Come and ping `amz3` or `OrangeShark` about it at `#guile@irc.freenode.net`.

And don't forget to add a unit test!
